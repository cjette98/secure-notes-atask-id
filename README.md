# Secure notes
Your task is to build a simple secure notetaking app.
The app should allow the user to add/edit/list notes. The access to the app should be protected
with biometric authentication, falling back to a text password. The notes should be encrypted
using a key protected by biometrics/a text password in a way that the notes are never stored
unencrypted.
